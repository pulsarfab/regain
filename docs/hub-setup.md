# Hub setup development preview

Regain Hub combines source devices into shared Switch, SafetyMonitor, and
ObservingConditions outputs. The current development branch can publish those
outputs through Alpaca or the native NINA providers. Both frontends can edit the
shared configuration. Native ASCOM hub outputs and broader proxy devices remain in progress;
this is not a released feature.

Windows sources can import ASCOM Switch, SafetyMonitor and ObservingConditions
drivers directly through private x86/x64 helpers. Add a **COM** source, enter the
installed driver's ProgID and select its registration bitness. Available choices
come from the host's installed helper capabilities. This does not connect through
Alpaca or require a Regain native ASCOM output. Select **Managed** to let the hub
own its client connection, or **Externally managed** to require an already open
connection without changing it. A managed legacy driver that is already connected
is borrowed; modern drivers acquire their own client connection.

COM calls have bounded deadlines and run outside the host. A stalled driver
cannot keep cached safety permission fresh or block other sources. Unknown write
or connection outcomes require explicit reconciliation; do not blindly repeat
them. Killing a private worker does not prove the upstream driver disconnected.
Other platforms can import a driver's exported Alpaca endpoint. Registered
fixture tests and both-bit machine SCM activation pass; installed vendor-driver
and interactive frontend acceptance remain on the plan.

To try the editor without equipment, copy
[`simulated-observatory.json`](../crates/regain-hub/examples/simulated-observatory.json)
to a local file and start the development executable with its absolute path:

```text
regain-alpaca --hub-config ABSOLUTE_PATH --port 11111
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:11111/setup/hub`. These example sources are explicitly
simulated, and safety starts unsafe. The example identities are for testing;
configuration initialization for a new installation is still being implemented.

1. Expand a source or output to edit its fields. Available choices and parameter
   descriptions come from the host. Saved IDs and device numbers stay fixed.
2. Use **Status** for cached source diagnostics or **Inspect** to open a temporary
   connection and read capabilities. Switch inspection supports bounded pages.
3. Select **Review changes**. Correct any field errors and inspect the preview.
   Validation does not connect equipment.
4. Disconnect all output clients, then select **Apply reviewed configuration**.
   The host checks the saved revision and writes the update atomically. Another
   editor's change causes a conflict instead of silently overwriting it.

If the outcome is uncertain, select **Reload saved configuration** before another
change. Reload explicitly opens a new setup connection and reads the saved
configuration and host status. It never repeats Apply, connects equipment or
starts the host. Other clients retain their leases. After host loss, equipment
clients still need explicit reconnect or HTTP frontend restart; broader
reconnect/resume controls remain in development. Stopping the HTTP frontend
leaves the shared host running.

Select **Manage upstream credentials** to save a complete Authorization header.
The masked input is cleared before sending; configuration holds only the resulting
reference. Protection, labels, descriptions and limits come from the same host
descriptors as native setup. Copy the reference into a source, review and apply.
For rotation, create a new reference, apply it, then remove the unused old one.
Saved configuration references are protected from deletion.

The editor retains the reference before sending, including if the reply is lost.
Reload and select **Read credential status** before another change. Status returns
busy while storage work is pending; no creation/removal is repeated automatically.
Retain the reference separately before navigating away or closing the page.
Neither browser nor managed string copies are claimed to be securely erased.

This is the actual browser editor against the production host with simulated
equipment. Its disposable credential was subsequently removed; the input is
empty and the configuration remains unchanged.

This screenshot shows a hardware-free test. It is evidence of the editor workflow,
not real-device acceptance. Simulation controls, richer
safety diagnostics, initialization, and conformance remain on
the [hub plan](hub-plan.md).

The current preview offers Switch v3, SafetyMonitor v3 and ObservingConditions v2
with nonblocking Connect/Disconnect and Connecting. Legacy Connected also works.
DeviceState reads cached operational values and omits unavailable Switch/Weather
readings; it never makes stale measurements fresh. Switch channels report
CanAsync=false. A failed asynchronous connection stays visible through Connecting
until an explicit connect or disconnect; polling does not retry it. Connected
means a lease on the virtual output, so use source diagnostics to assess upstream
health. Conformance-tool and real-device acceptance checks remain pending.

## Native NINA development preview

The plugin exports Switch, SafetyMonitor and Weather choices using NINA's
3.2.0.9001 interfaces. Each class includes a **configure** choice. Open its setup,
browse to the saved hub configuration, select **Load hub outputs**, then save the
desired output. Rescan equipment to see all saved choices, or connect the chosen
device. Names identify simulation explicitly. UUIDs identify outputs, so renaming
or reordering does not change the saved equipment selection.

Setup uses the existing Regain theme and a private local connection. It starts or
attaches to the shared host, without an HTTP listener or ASCOM output. Select
**Edit shared configuration** after loading outputs to edit sources, channel
mappings, safety policies and weather settings. Field labels, descriptions,
choices, defaults and bounds come from the host's schema. The selector and editor
do not acquire equipment leases.

1. Expand a source or output to edit its fields. IDs remain fixed and can be
   expanded for inspection; new items receive new IDs. Collections show up to
   32 items per page. Correct invalid input before changing the form structure.
2. Select **Review changes** to validate through the host and inspect the redacted
   configuration. Further edits invalidate that review.
3. Disconnect all output clients, then select **Apply reviewed configuration**.
   The editor sends one revision-checked request and reloads the saved result.
   A conflict or uncertain outcome requires reloading; Apply is never replayed.
4. Use **Source health** for saved host status or cached source diagnostics.
   Reading health does not open an equipment connection. Close the editor and
   select **Load hub outputs** again to refresh the output choices.

![Native hub configuration review before applying](images/hub-native-review-simulation.png)

These are renders of the actual WPF window during an automated simulation test
against the production host. They demonstrate setup; interactive NINA and
real-device acceptance remain pending. Initialization, live inspection and
simulation controls remain on the plan.

Use **Credentials** to save an upstream Authorization header in the host's
separate user storage. Its labels, descriptions, length limits and protection
description come from the host. The masked input is cleared before dispatch and
on reload/close; values are never returned or inserted into the configuration.
This does not promise erasure of every managed-string or OS copy.

Copy the resulting **Credential reference** into the source's settings, then
review and apply. For rotation, save a new credential, apply its reference, then
**Remove unused credential** for the old one. The host refuses removal while the
saved configuration uses it. Credential changes invalidate an earlier review.

The reference is chosen and retained before sending. If the reply is lost,
reload and select **Read credential status** for that reference before another
change; do not repeat creation. Status reports busy while a configuration or
credential operation is still running. The native editor keeps the reference
across reloads during this window; retain it separately before closing the window.
The web editor offers the same credential operations under **Manage upstream credentials**.

![Native credential setup against a simulated observatory](images/hub-native-credentials-simulation.png)

This is the actual shared WPF editor against the production host with simulated
equipment. The reference is a temporary fixture and the secret field is empty.

Select **Manage saved output choices** to view the saved choices for this class.
Each entry identifies its configuration path, hub instance and output UUID.
Removing an entry updates the native chooser list; it leaves the shared hub
configuration and connected clients running. Rescan equipment afterward. To add
it again, load its configuration and save that output. A competing save requires
an explicit reload before another change; unreadable selection files are preserved.

![Saved native output choices during an automated simulation](images/hub-native-selections-simulation.png)

Selections are stored in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Regain\hub-frontends.json`. They contain
the configuration path, hub instance and output IDs, class, label and simulation
marker. Source settings and policies remain in the host configuration. Competing
selection saves fail with a revision conflict; an unreadable file is not overwritten.
The development overrides are `REGAIN_HUB_HOST` for the host executable and
`REGAIN_HUB_BINDINGS` for the selection file.

Connecting a saved choice verifies its instance/output/class again. Changing the
configuration path cannot silently select a different instance. NINA and Alpaca
hold separate leases; disconnecting either frontend leaves the other available.
Getters never launch or reconnect the host. Reconnect explicitly after transport
loss; retired Switch objects cannot send commands in the new session.

Safety reads the host's current decision and returns unsafe on local failure.
Weather returns NaN for unavailable or stale measurements independently. Switch
gauges are read-only. When a writable capability cannot be checked, reconnect
after resolving the source failure to restore that control. Failed writable
readback raises an error: NINA's completion loop must not treat NaN as success.
No write is automatically replayed after an uncertain result.

Production-host and NINA-interface tests cover these behaviors. Interactive NINA,
conformance and real-device acceptance remain pending before release.

## Native ASCOM hub setup (development)

Open **Hub outputs setup** in the Regain ASCOM Start menu group, or run the
installed `Regain.ASCOM.Register.exe /hubsetup`. The manager reads saved choices
and machine registration inventory without attaching to the host or equipment.
Choose a Switch, SafetyMonitor or ObservingConditions output using the same
selector and configuration editor as native NINA. Loading outputs and editing
configuration explicitly attach to the local host without equipment leases.

Select a saved choice and **Register / refresh in ASCOM**. Windows requests
administrator approval; use the same Windows account. Both ASCOM Chooser views
receive the output, bound to this installation, selection file and user. Hub and
output UUIDs determine identity, so changing a label preserves its CLSID/ProgID.
Simulation remains visible in the Chooser name. Registering a choice does not
connect equipment; the ASCOM client's explicit connection does that.

Use **Remove ASCOM registration** before **Remove saved choice**. Registration
removal leaves connected clients running and can remove an owned orphan after
its selection file disappears. Entries belonging to another owner/install/file
or newer version are protected. After a failure or unknown completion, **Reload
inventory** and inspect `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Regain\ASCOM\registration.log` before
another action. The manager never repeats an uncertain registry edit or kills
its elevated helper. Inventory status describes records, not a live device test.

![ASCOM hub registration manager during a private simulation test](images/hub-ascom-registration-simulation.png)

This is an actual WPF render with private test registry roots and non-executable
fixture paths; no installed hardware driver was activated. Uninstall now removes
owned dynamic entries before deleting application files, preserving other installs
and settings. A cleanup failure retains the installation for explicit recovery.
Production-helper and installer lifecycle CI now pass, including installed
metadata, in-use protection, conflict recovery, orphan cleanup and other-install
preservation. Interactive frontend/vendor acceptance and conformance remain
required before this development feature is released.
